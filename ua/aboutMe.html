                Hello, my name is Mark. With over 6 years of experience in distributions, I have honed my skills as a
                sales manager and
                supervisor. However, I have always felt a strong inclination towards the world of technology and coding.
                The idea of
                venturing into IT had been brewing in my mind for quite some time, but it wasn't until I made a second
                attempt in a more
                mature age that I realized it was truly my passion.
                My journey into the realm of coding began with self-study. I immersed myself in online resources,
                devouring knowledge on
                HTML and CSS. As I delved deeper, I became captivated by the art of creating cutting-edge technologies.
                The more I
                learned, the more I craved an environment where I could apply and structure the knowledge I had
                acquired.
                Motivated by this desire, I made the decision to seek new opportunities that would allow me to grow
                further. I enrolled
                in an IT course, eager to expand my skill set, network with like-minded individuals, and unleash my full
                potential.
                Driven by my determination, I quickly progressed through the modules, often staying a few steps ahead of
                the curriculum.
                During the course, I had the opportunity to collaborate on team projects, where I not only demonstrated
                my technical
                prowess but also showcased my leadership skills. Guiding and motivating my team, I ensured the
                successful completion of
                our projects. These experiences solidified my excitement about working alongside intelligent and
                knowledgeable
                individuals who share a passion for building modern, impactful products.
                In terms of hard skills, I have a strong command of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Figma, and
                Git. I am
                proficient in creating adaptive, responsive, and cross-browser layouts, ensuring seamless user
                experiences across
                different devices and platforms.
                Now, standing at the intersection of my sales management background and my newfound expertise in web
                development, I am
                poised to embark on an exciting new chapter. I am eager to leverage my skills, collaborate with talented
                individuals,
                and contribute to the creation of innovative solutions that leave a lasting impact. I am wholeheartedly
                committed to
                doing whatever it takes to achieve these goals and make meaningful contributions to the team and the
                industry as a
                whole.
